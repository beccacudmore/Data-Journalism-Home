Becca Data Visualization Pitches

<p>1.	Spring is quickly approaching (hopefully) and once again, you’ll be able to hear the sweet sound of birds chirping. But while you might be well acquainted the sound of birds in New York, do you what they sound like in other parts of the world? How do different locations and climates shape the sound of bird songs? I’ve never seen such a world map that would allow listeners to do this—to access each country’s bird songs. This map could be published soon, because New Yorkers will be entering spring in about a month (fingers crossed) and thus, will be thinking about birds again. 

<p>My project would be an interactive world map that plays each country’s bird’s song as you scroll over or click each country. If not the country’s national bird, it could also be the sound of the country’s most endangered bird. Or, it could be interesting to play each country’s most endangered animal’s howl, chirp, bark, etc. I initially chose bird songs because there are a lot of online databases of birdcalls from across the world. However, this idea could also work with different country-specific sounds—depending on the sound databases available. 

<p>I could talk to Dina Lipkind, a psychology researcher at Hunter College in Manhattan, who studies vocal development in birds. She may be able to tell me why different birdcalls sound different in separate parts of the world.

<p>To create this project, I would need to learn how to snag a world map that’s being used as part of a data visualization project currently and then learn how to color/texturize that map. Then, I would scrape and enter the link to different bird/animal calls into the code that correlates to the physical space of each country on the map. 

<p>2.	This project idea is similar to the pitch above. But, rather than employing bird calls; I’d like to explore a world map using human oral chants and songs specific to each country/region. Smithsonian has an incredible, downloadable human song database, their Global Sound Library. I would like to have these chants and songs play alongside how long the country has been inhabitated by modern humans. It would be interesting to see how the sound of the song/chant relates to the age of the culture. 

<p>I would need to learn the same skills that I would for the bird song map to create this interactive, human song map. Barry S. Brook of the doctoral program in music at The City University of New York Graduate Center would be the perfect contact for this project. Many news sources have sound maps that I can reference. For example, PBS has an interactive sound map of China that is similar to what I’d like to do with this project. This project could be published alongside a story on loss of cultural diversity, because as we lose world languages, we too lose their songs and chants.
